# Django API server Project
This description is for api project. used Django.
ONLY FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIROMENT.
Link for DEPOLY ENV is here: https://github.com/tncks/authors-src-productionVerdeployed

# NOTICE
This is only for local development test project sources, not for PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT at api domain server.
So, You should use only these codes for local dev before production or deploy, and also should seperate from production codes later.

You can not deploy to server or docker using these code in production env, if you do, you will get so many errors when compiling it.
Therefore We recommend you to use only this for your personal toy project or local dev test, only.
